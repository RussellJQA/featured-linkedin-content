# The Google Brain Project
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*(by gpt-4o-mini)*

In silicon's embrace, great minds unite,
With Andrew Ng, a pioneer so bold,
And Jeff Deane, whose vision takes to flight,
In realms of data, secrets to unfold.

The "cat man" he is called, for he has shown,
Through neural nets, the feline forms arise,
In pixels drawn, their essence overthrown,
A world of wonders seen through coded eyes.

Together they have forged a path anew,
In learning's depths, where algorithms play,
With every line of code, the future grew,
As knowledge blooms in bright and wondrous way.

So let us praise the minds that dare to dream,
In Googleâ€™s halls, where thoughts and visions gleam.
