I created this as a repository to feature some of [my LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/russelljqa/) [articles](https://www.linkedin.com/in/russelljqa/recent-activity/articles/), [posts](https://www.linkedin.com/in/russelljqa/recent-activity/all/), and associated files (image files, .gifs, .py files, .ipynb files, etc.)

Because LinkedIn posts don't support Markdown, some of my posts may look better here than on LinkedIn.

Here's my first featured post:

#### 1. [ChatGPT 'study mode': A new ChatGPT mode which helps you think for yourself! ðŸ¤” Rather than having ChatGPT do you thinking for you! ðŸ§ ðŸš«](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/activity-7356801249792417794-uBuR/) â€” posted July 31, 2025
