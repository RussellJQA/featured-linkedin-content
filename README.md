I created this GitHub repository to highlight some of [my LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/russelljqa/) [articles](https://www.linkedin.com/in/russelljqa/recent-activity/articles/) and [posts](https://www.linkedin.com/in/russelljqa/recent-activity/all/), and their associated code and/or image files.

Because LinkedIn posts don't support Markdown, some of my posts may look better here than on LinkedIn. My articles should look essentially the same here and on LinkedIn, except that LinkedIn doesn't allow an article's featured image to be an animated .gif file.

## Here's the first article I'm highlighting:

### **- 1.** Free, Fun, AI-Focused Introduction to Python? - Yes; Taught by Google's 'cat-man'? - Yes and No
Posted August 1, 2025<br>

- [The article on GitHub](articles/20250804-fun-python-course/article.md)<br>
- [The article's GitHub README.md](articles/20250804-fun-python-course/README.md)<br>

## And the first post I'm highlighting:
